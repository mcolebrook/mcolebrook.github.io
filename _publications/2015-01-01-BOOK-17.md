### Abstract
We present a software application developed to optimize the annual planning of visits of a brewing company’s sales/marketing staff to their customers. Each of these customers must be annually visited a provided number of times. Thus, each salesperson is assigned to a set of customers that must be visited each week. The application will assign all the visits of a salesperson to each customer so that all weeks should have more or less the same number of visits. By virtue of this approach, the brewing company diminished their marketing operating costs, as well as improved their customer relationships.
