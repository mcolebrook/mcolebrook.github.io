### Abstract
We address the dynamic lot-sizing problem considering multiple items and storage capacity. Despite we can easily characterize a subset of optimal solutions just extending the properties of the single-item case, these results are not helpful to design an efficient algorithm. Accordingly, heuristics are appropriate approaches to obtain near-optimal solutions for this NP-hard problem. Thus, we propose a heuristic procedure based on the smoothing technique, which is tested on a large set of randomly generated instances. The computational results show that the method is able to build policies that are both easily implemented and very effective, since they are on average 5% above the best solution reported by CPLEX. Moreover, an additional computational experiment is carried out to show that the performance of this new heuristic is on average better and more robust than other methods previously proposed for this problem.
