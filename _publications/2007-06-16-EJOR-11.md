### Abstract
Given a network with several weights per node and several lengths per edge, we address the problem of locating a facility on the network such that the convex combinations of the center and median objective functions are minimized. Since we consider several weights and several lengths, various objective functions should be minimized, and hence we have to solve a multicriteria cent-dian location problem. A polynomial algorithm to characterize the efficient location point set on the network is developed. Furthermore, this model can generalize other problems such as the multicriteria center problem and the multicriteria median problem. Computing time results on random planar networks considering different combinations of weights and lengths are reported, which strengthen the polynomial complexity of the procedure.
