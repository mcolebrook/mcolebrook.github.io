### Abstract
Recent papers have developed efficient algorithms for the location of an undesirable (obnoxious) 1-center on general networks with n nodes and m edges. Even though the theoretical complexity of these algorithms is fine, the computational time required to get the solution can be diminished using a different model formulation and slightly improving the upper bounds. Thus, we present a new O(mn) algorithm, which is more straightforward and computationally faster than the previous ones. Computing time results comparing the former approaches with the proposed algorithm are supplied.
