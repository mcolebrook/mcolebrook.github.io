excerpt: 'We consider the problem of locating a single facility on a network in the presence of r >= 2 median‐type objectives, represented by r sets of edge weights (or lengths) corresponding toeach of the objectives. When r = 1, then one gets the classical 1‐median problem whereonly the vertices need to be considered for determining the optimal location (Hakimi [1]).The paper examines the case when r >= 2 and provides a method to determine the non‐dominatedset of points for locating the facility.' #'This paper is about the number 1. The number 2 is left for future work.'
