### Abstract
We address the dynamic lot size problem assuming time-varying storage capacities. The planning horizon is divided into T periods and stockouts are not allowed. Moreover, for each period, we consider a setup cost, a holding unit cost and a production/ordering unit cost, which can vary through the planning horizon. Although this model can be solved using O(T3) algorithms already introduced in the specialized literature, we show that under this cost structure an optimal solution can be obtained in O(T log T) time. In addition, we show that when production/ordering unit costs are assumed to be constant (i.e., the Wagner–Whitin case), there exists an optimal plan satisfying the Zero Inventory Ordering (ZIO) property.
