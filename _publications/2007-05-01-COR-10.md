### Abstract
This paper is devoted to the location of undesirable facilities on multicriteria networks. Firstly, we analyze the undesirable center and median models establishing new properties to characterize the efficient solutions and rules to remove inefficient edges. Then, by means of a convex combination of these two latter functions, we address the -anti-cent-dian problem providing an effective rule to remove inefficient edges as well as a polynomial algorithm that solves the problem. Finally, we also comment on how this model can be slightly modified to generalize other models presented in the literature.
