### Abstract
We have developed a software application that optimizes the annual planning of visits of a brewery sales/marketing staff to their customers. Each customer must be annually visited a provided number of times. Besides, each salesperson is assigned to a set of customers that must be visited each week. The application has to assign all the visits of a salesperson to each customer so that all weeks should have more or less the same number of visits. With this approach, the brewery company wants to diminish their marketing operating costs, as well as improving their customer relationships.
