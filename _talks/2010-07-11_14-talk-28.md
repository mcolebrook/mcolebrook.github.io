### Abstract
We address the dynamic lot-sizing problem considering multiple items and storage capacity. Despite we can easily characterize a subset of optimal solutions just extending the properties of the single-item case, these results are not helpful to design an efficient algorithm. Accordingly, heuristics are appropriate approaches to obtain near-optimal solutions for this NP-hard problem. Thus, we propose a heuristic procedure based on the smoothing technique, which is tested on a large set of randomly generated instances.
