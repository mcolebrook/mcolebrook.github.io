### Abstract
Most companies schedule their operations for a finite planning horizon consisting of several weeks or months, which are referred to as periods. In particular, the problem of determining the optimal production/replenishment quantities for multiple items at each period is addressed. However, this problem becomes intractable when inventory capacities are introduced. Accordingly, we have developed a heuristic procedure which derives near optimal solutions in reasonable running times. This algorithm could be considered as an add-on module within an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application.
